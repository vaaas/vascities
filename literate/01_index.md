# Vascities

Vascities is an Electron-based static site generator with integration with Neocities. It allows the creation of a static site / blog with a GUI. It's meant to be easier for a new user who doesn't have knowledge of web development tooling.

# electron index

Electron apps start from the `index.js` file. We simply create a new window and point it to a preload script. The preload script is generated by webpack. Vascities uses the Vue library.

```javascript index.js
const electron = require('electron')
const path = require('path')

function main() {
    const win = new electron.BrowserWindow({
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        webPreferences: {
            preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
            nodeIntegration: true,
        },
    })
    // win.removeMenu()
    win.loadFile('index.html')
}

electron.app.whenReady().then(main)
```

We use `index.html`, which is a mostly empty page. The app contents essentially modify this page continuously, like with a single page application.

The root Vue app is going to be mounted on the `body` element directly.

```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset='utf-8'/>
        <title>Vascities</title>
    </head>

    <body id='app'></body>
</html>
```
